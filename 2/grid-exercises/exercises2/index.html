          <h1>The Eras Tour</h1>
          <p>
            Swift's stadium tour swept through more than a dozen US cities plus
            Mexico City this summer. The Eras Tour is a love letter to her
            impressive musical career and the fans who have seen her through it.
            The numbers indicate the tour draws massive public appeal. The tour
            is projected to gross $1 billion, including Swift's overseas tour
            next spring.

          stage with a giant, curved widescreen a rhombic middle stage and a
